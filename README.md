C++ implementation of the Jinja2 Python template engine. This library brings support of powerful Jinja2 template features into the C++ world, reports  dynamic HTML pages and source code generation.

## Introduction

Main features of Jinja2C++:
-  Easy-to-use public interface. Just load templates and render them.
-  Conformance to [Jinja2 specification](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/)
-  Full support of narrow- and wide-character strings both for templates and parameters.
-  Built-in reflection for the common C++ types, nlohmann and rapid JSON libraries.
-  Powerful full-featured Jinja2 expressions with filtering (via '|' operator) and 'if'-expressions.
-  Control statements (`set`, `for`, `if`, `filter`, `do`, `with`).
-  Templates extension, including and importing
-  Macros
-  Rich error reporting.
-  Shared template environment with templates cache support

For instance, this simple code:

```c++
#include <jinja2cpp/template.h>

std::string source = R"(
{{ ("Hello", 'world') | join }}!!!
{{ ("Hello", 'world') | join(', ') }}!!!
{{ ("Hello", 'world') | join(d = '; ') }}!!!
{{ ("Hello", 'world') | join(d = '; ') | lower }}!!!
)";

Template tpl;
tpl.Load(source);

std::string result = tpl.RenderAsString({}).value();
```

produces the result string:

```
Helloworld!!!
Hello, world!!!
Hello; world!!!
hello; world!!!
```

## Getting started

To use Jinja2C++ in your project you have to:
* Clone the Jinja2C++ repository
* Build it according to the [instructions](https://jinja2cpp.dev/docs/build_and_install.html)
* Link to your project.

Usage of Jinja2C++ in the code is pretty simple:
1.  Declare the jinja2::Template object:

```c++
jinja2::Template tpl;
```

2.  Populate it with template:

```c++
tpl.Load("{{ 'Hello World' }}!!!");
```

3.  Render the template:

```c++
std::cout << tpl.RenderAsString({}).value() << std::endl;
```

and get:

`
Hello World!!!
`

That's all!

More detailed examples and features description can be found in the documentation: [https://jinja2cpp.dev/docs/usage](https://jinja2cpp.dev/docs/usage)

## Current Jinja2 support
Currently, Jinja2C++ supports the limited number of Jinja2 features. By the way, Jinja2C++ is planned to be a full [jinja2 specification](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/)-conformant. The current support is limited to:
-  expressions. You can use almost every expression style: simple, filtered, conditional, and so on.
-  the big number of filters (**sort, default, first, last, length, max, min, reverse, unique, sum, attr, map, reject, rejectattr, select, selectattr, pprint, dictsort, abs, float, int, list, round, random, trim, title, upper, wordcount, replace, truncate, groupby, urlencode, capitalize, escape**)
-  the big number of testers (**eq, defined, ge, gt, iterable, le, lt, mapping, ne, number, sequence, string, undefined, in, even, odd, lower, upper**)
-  the number of functions (**range**, **loop.cycle**)
-  'if' statement (with 'elif' and 'else' branches)
-  'for' statement (with 'else' branch and 'if' part support)
-  'include' statement
-  'import'/'from' statements
-  'set' statement (both line and block)
-  'filter' statement
-  'extends'/'block' statements
-  'macro'/'call' statements
-  'with' statement
-  'do' extension statement
-  recursive loops
-  space control

Full information about Jinja2 specification support and compatibility table can be found here: [https://jinja2cpp.dev/docs/j2_compatibility.html](https://jinja2cpp.dev/docs/j2_compatibility.html).

## Supported compilers
Compilation of Jinja2C++ tested on the following compilers (with C++14 and C++17 enabled features):
-  Linux gcc 5.5 - 9.0
-  Linux clang 5.0 - 9
-  MacOS X-Code 9
-  MacOS X-Code 10
-  MacOS X-Code 11 (C++14 in default build, C++17 with externally-provided boost)
-  Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 - 2019 x86, x64
-  MinGW gcc compiler 7.3
-  MinGW gcc compiler 8.1

**Note:** Support of gcc version >= 9.x or clang version >= 8.0 depends on the version of the Boost library provided.

## Build and install
Jinja2C++ has several external dependencies:
-  `boost` library (at least version 1.65) 
-  `nonstd::expected-lite` [https://github.com/martinmoene/expected-lite](https://github.com/martinmoene/expected-lite)
-  `nonstd::variant-lite` [https://github.com/martinmoene/variant-lite](https://github.com/martinmoene/variant-lite)
-  `nonstd::value-ptr-lite` [https://github.com/martinmoene/value-ptr-lite](https://github.com/martinmoene/value-ptr-lite)
-  `nonstd::optional-lite` [https://github.com/martinmoene/optional-lite](https://github.com/martinmoene/optional-lite)
-  `nonstd::string-view-lite` [https://github.com/martinmoene/string-view-lite](https://github.com/martinmoene/string-view-lite)
-  `fmtlib::fmt` [https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
-  `robin-hood-hashing` [https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing)

In simplest case to compile Jinja2C++ you need:

1.  Install CMake build system (at least version 3.0)
2.  Clone jinja2cpp repository and update submodules:

```
> git clone https://github.com/flexferrum/Jinja2Cpp.git
> git submodule -q update --init
```

3.  Create build directory:

```
> cd Jinja2Cpp
> mkdir build
```

4.  Run CMake and build the library:

```
> cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to install folder>
> cmake --build . --target all
```
"Path to install folder" here is a path to the folder where you want to install Jinja2C++ lib.

5. Install library:

```
> cmake --build . --target install
```

In this case, Jinja2C++ will be built with internally-shipped dependencies and install them respectively. But Jinja2C++ supports build with externally-provided deps. Different Jinja2C++ usage scenarios can be found in this repository: https://github.com/jinja2cpp/examples-build

### Usage with conan.io dependency manager
Jinja2C++ can be used as conan.io package. In this case, you should do the following steps:

1. Install conan.io according to the documentation ( https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html )
2. Register the following remote conan.io repositories:
    * https://api.bintray.com/conan/martinmoene/nonstd-lite
    * https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan
    * https://api.bintray.com/conan/flexferrum/conan-packages

The sample command is: `conan remote add martin https://api.bintray.com/conan/martinmoene/nonstd-lite`

3. Add a reference to Jinja2C++ package (`jinja2cpp/1.0.0@flexferrum/testing`) to your conanfile.txt, conanfile.py or CMakeLists.txt. For instance, with the usage of `conan-cmake` integration it could be written this way:

```cmake
include (../../cmake/conan.cmake)
if (NOT MSVC)
    set (CONAN_SETTINGS SETTINGS compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11)
endif ()

conan_cmake_run(REQUIRES 
                    jinja2cpp/1.0.0@flexferrum/testing
                    gtest/1.7.0@bincrafters/stable
                BASIC_SETUP
                ${CONAN_SETTINGS}
                OPTIONS 
                    jinja2cpp:shared=False
                    gtest:shared=False
                BUILD missing)
                
set (TARGET_NAME jinja2cpp_build_test)

add_executable (${TARGET_NAME} main.cpp)

target_link_libraries (${TARGET_NAME} ${CONAN_LIBS})
set_target_properties (${TARGET_NAME} PROPERTIES
            CXX_STANDARD 14
            CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

```


### Additional CMake build flags
You can define (via -D command-line CMake option) the following build flags:

-  **JINJA2CPP_BUILD_TESTS** (default TRUE) - to build or not to Jinja2C++ tests.
-  **JINJA2CPP_STRICT_WARNINGS** (default TRUE) - Enable strict mode compile-warnings(-Wall -Werror, etc).
-  **JINJA2CPP_MSVC_RUNTIME_TYPE** (default /MD) - MSVC runtime type to link with (if you use Microsoft Visual Studio compiler).
-  **JINJA2CPP_DEPS_MODE** (default "internal") - modes for dependency handling. Following values possible:
    -  `internal` In this mode Jinja2C++ build script uses dependencies (include `boost`) shipped as subprojects. Nothing needs to be provided externally.
    -  `external-boost` In this mode Jinja2C++ build script uses only `boost` as an externally-provided dependency. All other dependencies are taken from subprojects.
    -  `external` In this mode all dependencies should be provided externally. Paths to `boost`, `nonstd-*` libs, etc. should be specified via standard CMake variables (like `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or libname_DIR)
    -  `conan-build` Special mode for building Jinja2C++ via conan recipe.


### Build with C++17 standard enabled
In case of C++17 standard enabled for your project you should define `variant_CONFIG_SELECT_VARIANT=variant_VARIANT_NONSTD nssv_CONFIG_SELECT_STRING_VIEW=nssv_STRING_VIEW_NONSTD optional_CONFIG_SELECT_OPTIONAL=optional_OPTIONAL_NONSTD` macros in the build settings.
